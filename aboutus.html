                            <p>In January of 2005, the Zhou's Coffee Shop opened at 45 Main Street, Allston. 
                                The site was the former home of the 1369 Jazz Club, a well known local bar and music venue. 
                                In June 1993 we opened a second store in nearby Central Square.
                            <p>From the beginning, we envisioned Zhou's as more than just a place to get coffee. 
                                We offer the very best coffees and teas available. 
                                We strive to create a comfortable, inviting atmosphere and to be an integral part of the community. 
                                Many friendships, including several marriages, have developed at Zhou's. 
                                Several books and many theses have been written at our tables. 
                                We take pride in being a good neighbor and local gathering place. 
                                We are dedicated to maintaining this feeling.</p>

                            <p>We have been fortunate to be the recipient of many awards and accolades. 
                                We continue to pursue our goals in an effort to achieve excellence in all we do. 
                                We intend to survive the onslaught of chains and to endure long into the future. 
                                We will continue our commitment to our neighborhood and community.</p>

                            <p>Thanks for making us!! </p>
